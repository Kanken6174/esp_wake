# esp_wake
Esp wake is an esp32S2 based alarm clock i made for myself using an esp32S2-mini2 module, various sensors and a modular frontend for displaying the time.   

The hardware is not yet open source as V2 still has audio issues i'll fix with V3

a few pictures:

removed frontend (delided esp and the audio circuit is a bit toasty, that's only because of multiple reworks damaging it overtime):<br/>
